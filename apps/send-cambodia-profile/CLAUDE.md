# The Send Cambodia · Team Work Style Profile

A bilingual (Khmer / English) work-style survey for The Send Cambodia campaign executive team.
People either take a 48-statement survey or upload their Culture Index PDF report. The app then shows
each person's profile, how far their current job stretches them, and how well they fit their lane's
job description. It started as a claude.ai artifact and is now being moved to Netlify.

Owner: Uriah Lyford (Media Director, The Send Cambodia).

## Layout

```
public/index.html            the whole app: UI, content, scoring, Culture Index PDF reader
public/platform.js           adapter: implements window.claude.use(...) on top of /api/*
netlify/functions/results.mjs    GET / PUT / DELETE results, stored in Netlify Blobs ("results" store)
netlify/functions/read-image.mjs optional: reads a photo/screenshot of a CI chart with the Anthropic API
data/seed.json               results exported from the claude.ai version; loaded once on first request
```

`index.html` still talks to the claude.ai artifact runtime API (`claude.use("db" | "user" | "downloads" | "sample")`).
`platform.js` provides those same calls for Netlify. Keep that contract, so the page can still be republished
as a claude.ai artifact unchanged if needed. Put new platform behaviour in `platform.js`, not in the page.

## Run and deploy

```
npm install
netlify login
netlify init                     # create or link the site
netlify env:set TEAM_CODE  "<code everyone on the team uses>"
netlify env:set ADMIN_CODE "<Uriah's code: delete, CSV, entering answers for others>"
netlify env:set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "<optional, only for reading photos/screenshots>"
netlify dev                      # local, http://localhost:8888
netlify deploy --prod
```

The first request after deploy copies `data/seed.json` into Blobs and sets `_meta/seeded`, so it runs once.
**This app lives in the public `gonpreah` repo, so `data/seed.json` is committed empty and must stay empty.**
Never commit real results. The two results from the claude.ai version (Uriah, Andrew) are re-entered in the
app after the first deploy (retake the survey or re-upload the Culture Index PDF).

It is its own Netlify site, separate from the YWAM Siem Reap website: in Netlify, set the base directory to
`apps/send-cambodia-profile` (publish `public`, functions `netlify/functions` come from this folder's
`netlify.toml`). The repo root `netlify.toml` belongs to the website and does not build this app.

## Access model (deliberately simple; improve if needed)

- Everyone enters `TEAM_CODE` once per device (saved in localStorage). `ADMIN_CODE` gives the admin role.
- Each device gets a random id (`d_...`). A member can only write the result whose id is their device id.
  The admin can write or delete any id.
- Codes are shared secrets, not accounts. If stronger access is needed, swap in Netlify Identity or
  magic-link email in `platform.js` + `roleFor()` in `results.mjs`; the page itself shouldn't need to change.
- All pages send `noindex`.

## Data model (one Blobs entry per person, key = id)

```
name, lane (point|outcomes|mobilization|finance|media|communications|operations|worship|outreach|systems|other),
role, updatedAt,
scores    {ini, ppl, pac, str, log, cre}  0–10, natural profile
jobScores {same}                          0–10, what their current job asks (optional)
answers / jobAnswers  [24 ints 1–5]       survey only
source: "ci", ci: {traits:{A..I}, job:{A..I}, traitsArrow, jobArrow, pattern}   Culture Index uploads only
```
`results.mjs` `clean()` keeps only these fields. Update it if you add fields.

## Scoring (all in index.html)

- Survey: 6 traits × 4 statements, one reverse-scored per trait, mapped to 0–10. Part 2 repeats the same
  statements as "how much does your job ask this of you".
- Culture Index → app traits: A→Initiative, B→People energy, C→Pace (reversed: 10 − C), D→Structure,
  L→Logic, I→Creativity. A–D are read **relative to the red arrow** of the Traits chart (arrow becomes 5).
  The Job chart uses the Traits arrow too, so the gap between the charts matches how CI draws it. L and I are absolute.
- CI PDF reader (`parseCIPdf`): uses pdf.js 3.11.174 from cdnjs. It reads the vector drawing of page 1: dots by
  fill colour (A red, B yellow, C blue, D green, L purple, I light blue), first six = Traits, next six = Job;
  red vertical lines = arrows; scale origin X0 = 159, one step = 40 drawing units. Verified against Uriah's report.
  If a report doesn't match this layout, it falls back to rendering page 1 and `/api/read-image`.
- Lane fit: `LANES` holds 2–4 target ranges per lane, taken from "What it takes" in the campaign job
  descriptions. Fit % = mean of max(0, 1 − distance/4) over the lane's key traits. Strong ≥ 85, some stretch ≥ 60.
  Targets are Claude's reading of the job descriptions and are expected to be tuned with Uriah.
- "Big job stretch" = any trait where job − natural ≥ 3.

## Team views (Team results page)

Four tabs: **Team shape** (default), People, **Compare**, Lanes and job fit.

- Team shape (`vShape`): one 0–10 line per trait with a dot per person (initials, own colour, stacked when
  close), the team average as a dark line, and the names at each end (≤ 3.5 and ≥ 6.5). Above it, cards from
  `teamInsights()`: where the team leans (average ≥ 6.5 or ≤ 3.5, else the most extreme trait if ≥ 1 from 5),
  ends nobody covers and ends only one person covers (shown from 3 people up), and the traits where jobs pull
  hardest (mean job − natural ≥ 1.5). Respects the lane filter. Tapping a dot opens that person in People.
- Compare (`vCompare`): pick 2–4 people, natural or job profile, same dot lines plus numbers, then one talking
  point per pair from `pairTalk()` (largest difference ≥ 3, and shared highs).
- Person colours: `--c1`…`--c12`, assigned by alphabetical order of all results, so a person keeps one colour.
- New Khmer strings for these views also need the fluent-speaker review.

## Known items / next steps

1. Seed data: Uriah's record was saved before arrows were read. It has been recalculated in seed.json from his
   PDF (traits arrow 2.75, job arrow 7). Andrew Lee's record keeps its claude.ai id, so if he retakes it on Netlify
   he'll get a second entry; delete the old one as admin.
2. Have a fluent Khmer speaker review every Khmer string (all statements, lane names, lane "why" lines).
3. Consider vendoring pdf.js into `public/vendor/` instead of loading it from cdnjs.
4. Lane targets may need tuning; consider making them editable by the admin (store in Blobs).
5. There are no automated tests yet. Approach used so far: bundle `results.mjs` with esbuild, alias
   `@netlify/blobs` to an in-memory mock, serve `public/` + the function from a small Node server, and drive it
   with Playwright at a 390px viewport (survey, CI upload with a real report PDF, team tab, lanes tab, delete, CSV,
   member vs admin).

## Principles

- It is a conversation tool, not a hiring test. Keep that wording in the UI.
- Bilingual everywhere: every user-facing string goes through `L(en, km)` or `one(en, km)`.
- Store numbers only; never store uploaded report files.
